# REST API Project

This project is a spring application that creates three API endpoints: a quote of the day, a definition of the day, and a magic 8-ball service. The quote endpoint returns a random quote upon a GET request. Similarly, the definition endpoint returns a random word and definition following a GET request. The 8-ball service takes in a question via a POST, and returns a magic 8-ball themed answer.
